Requirement of rizz app:

We will have a start message like "Rizz app tells me to reply with" in the "Me" voice id
The UI will have top bar,
A image in the center of the screen,
A text input at the bottom of the screen 
after the starter message, the system should read aloud the text message which is in the chat bot.

when the start message is read aloud the text input should be blurred, and after it is read aloud the text input should be unblurred.
