me: Hey mom, can you send me $80? I need to pay a school fee today.
them: What fee? Why are you telling me last minute?
me: They just reminded us today, and they said it has to be paid before 5 PM.
them: Well I can't just throw money every time something pops up. No.
me: Mom please, it's actually important.
them: I said no. You need to start planning better.
me: I'm literally going to get locked out of class if I don't pay.
them: Not my problem today. Figure it out.
 
> Conversation with Dad <
me: Dad, can you help me? I need $80 for a school fee.
them: What fee? Didn't you already pay everything?
me: No, this is a new one. I asked mom but she shut me down.
them: Yeah... she's in one of her moods today. How much you need again?
me: Just $80.
them: Alright, let me talk to her first.
me: Please don't make it a whole thing.
them: I'll handle it. Sit tight.

> Conversation with Mom <
them: Did you seriously run to your father after I said no?
me: I wasn't "running," I just asked him for help.
them: Same thing. You always go behind my back when I don't give you what you want.
me: Mom, I literally just needed the money. It wasn't some strategy.
them: Don't smart-talk me. You know exactly what you did.
me: I wasn't trying to start a fight.
them: Too late. Now your dad thinks I'm being "unreasonable."

> Conversation with Dad <
them: Okay, I talked to her. She's annoyed, but I'll send the money anyway.
me: Thank you, seriously. I appreciate it.
them: Try not to stir things up with her today, alright?
me: I didn't even do anything.
them: Yeah, well... just let it cool down.

> Conversation with Mom <
them: Your dad sent you the money, didn't he?
me: Yeah... thanks for checking.
them: Next time, don't make me look like the bad guy.
me: Mom, I wasn't trying to. I just needed it quickly.
them: Then tell me sooner. Not when it's due in two hours.
me: I promise I'll be better about it.
them: Good. And clean your room when you get home.`;
